The materials used for this building were mainly cypress wood paneling, steel beams, concrete leaves, glass, and pine wood flooring.<sup>5</sup></p>

      </div>
      <div class="container text-center">
        <p class="lead mb-5">This short video<sup>2</sup> on the Menil Collection discusses the process of creating the building, as well as the reasons for its creation. Interestingly, this video ties together the Menil House ad the Menil Collection, and the architecture is quite similar. However, in my experience of the Menil Collection, it does not feel like a home. Homes have souls and life, while the only soul from the Menil Collection comes from the artwork on its walls. The building itself feels like an echo chamber for the spirit of the art it hosts, rather than a presence of its own.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Websites</h2>
        <h4 class="mb-5">The Menil Collection</h4>
        <div class="container text-center">
        <p class="lead mb-5">The article I found<sup>3</sup> discusses features of the Menil Collection to describe why it was chosen to win the AIA Twenty-Five Year Award. Through this article I learned that the ‘leaves’ of the ceiling were designed to allow maximum natural light into the museum without damaging the artwork, and these were created specifically for the building via complex solar calculations. The museum itself has 300 of these leaves.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">For the most part I agree with the author’s analysis of the building, but the author states that one of the primary objectives of the building is to blend in with nature. I disagree, and believe that the building is designed instead to seamlessly blend with the community, and that it is the community which attempts to blend in with nature. I believe the addition of natural light is included to allow the public to feel that the building and the community are one and the same, that one has not entered into a separate space. The goal of the museum is to place artwork into life and into the community, not to disrupt from that. Were the community to be heavily industrial, the museum would reflect that.[]</p>
      </div>
        <h4 class="mb-5">Renzo Piano</h4>
        <p class = "lead mb-5">This article<sup>6</sup> discusses Rezo Piano and his work as a 'Spotlight' piece. Through this I learned that Renzo Piano worked for Louis Kahn for 5 years, and won a contest for the design of the Centre Pompidou in France when he was 34, thus launching his own independent career. He is one of the largest museum architects in the world and is widely celebrated for his light buildings as opposed to the more traditional museum styles. He has been compared to the likes of da Vinci and Michaelangelo.</p>
        <p class = "lead mb-5"> Renzo Piano is quoted as saying, “I think it ['style'] is a trap. But what I don’t hate is 'intelligence' or 'coherence.' Because coherence is not about shape, it is about something stronger, more humanistic, more poetic even.” Piano does not believe he has a single, cohesive style between his various buildings. He tries to vary his buildings according to what each building needs to be. While many analysts of Piano's buildings like to discuss Piano's style, Piano himself does not believe he has a specific architectoral style.

        <h4 class="mb-5"><i>The Menil Collection: Art Spaces</i><sup>7</sup></h4>
        <p class="lead mb-5">Published by the Menil Collection and written by the assistant curator, this book highlights the accomplishments of the de Menil family. While the text begins by focusing on the background of the Menil Collection's creation, it eventually follows the de Menil family through their journey of art collection, later additions to the Menil Collection (such as the Cy Twombly Gallery), and dive into designing Chapels. The novel focuses on the philosophies of the de Menil family: what they wanted out of their buildings and their lives. For the Menil Collection, Dominique de Menil wanted a space for the public to have the same special, immersive artistic experiences that she so cherised.</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The Menil Collection radiates a sense of peace upon entering. The glass wall upon entering separates you from nature and simultaneously makes you feel closer to the community. The main spaces of the building are vast, open, and bathed in natural light. The white walls and dark floors cause your eyes to be immediately drawn to the artwork, and the shifting natural light throughout the day means a gallery can look different ten minutes after you view it. The diffused light from the ceiling at times arcs down the white walls, making it feel as though the light is directly pointing at the exhibitions. Some exhibits are surrounded by glass walls that overlook small jungles, giving the exhibitions a feeling closer to nature and more primitive. The center rooms are without natural light and painted a dark blue, allowing the eye to be drawn only to the pieces of art illuminated by soft spotlights. The building appears relatively small until you are standing directly in front of it, at which point the building scales well above your head. The inside of the building with its open floor plans and high ceilings feels very large, giving you the sense of being surrounded by something grandeouse and important. The building itself does not detract from the artwork. The creaking floors remind you that you are a part of the environment, that you are actively witnessing art. It serves as a grounding platform when the rest of the exhibition is silent. The cubistic rooms, leading into other cubistic rooms, guide you through the galleries in an unassuming fashion. The diffusion of light appears to make the ceiling glow, raising all of the artwork under its awning to an ethereal status. The park outside the collection allows families to play together, allowing the artwork to also be humbled, and become part of the community.</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">“I was surprised it had such a modernistic look for being built in the 1980s. I was not expecting that. It was also so unique with the louvered ceiling to redirect the light. I don’t think there’s another museum that does that. It’s fantastic. Other than the ceiling it feels really plain. It doesn’t make the art take a backseat. I thought it was fascinating that it was in the middle of a very modest neighborhood with really small homes” – Linda Foster</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The ceiling leaves provide a stark contrast between natural light and the exhibition lights, cool vs warm. During the day the contrast appears the most stark, but as the sun sets the outside light more closely resembles the exhibitions. This contrast highlights the time of day within the building and makes the people in the building more aware of what's happening outside</p>

      <p class  = "lead">Located in the Museum District of Houston, The Menil Collection finds itself in the middle of a neighborhood. The collection faces the public park and, in a way, is the public park. This location allows the artwork in the collection to become a part of the community, thus fulfilling the vision of the founders to include more artwork in everyday lives. The expansions of the main collection, the Cy Twombly Gallery, the Writing Center, and the bookstore, all exist as separate buildings, integrating the art collection even further into the neighborhood.</p>
